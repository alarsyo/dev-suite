# dev-suite

dev-suite is a set of tools designed to redistribute distributed work

## Current Status
Highly experimental and not for general use.

## Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct is strictly enforced. See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for more
details.

## PRs and Issues
GitHub is a mirrored repo and all PRs and Issues will be closed. The point of
these tools is to not depend on these things. This is merely to provide a public
way to clone the source code. Currently this is mostly a private project. If you
want to add issues or send a PR you can email me at `self@mgattozzi.dev`, but
I doubt I will respond or accept changes currently
